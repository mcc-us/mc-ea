- You must file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax, if:

1. Your net earnings from self-employment (excluding church employee income) were **$400 or more**, or

2. You had church employee income of **$108.28 or more**. (See Table 1-3.)

3. Use Schedule SE (Form 1040) to figure your self-employment tax. Self-employment tax is comparable to the social security and Medicare tax withheld from an employee's wages. For more information about this tax, see **Pub. 334**.



- **Dependents NOTES**: p.8

1. A child is generally responsible for their own tax return, but a parent or guardian must file it if the child cannot due to age or other reasons.


2. A child's earnings are included in their gross income,
 not the parent's, even if the parent has legal rights to them, but the parent is liable for any unpaid tax.


3. Parents can elect to include a child's interest and dividend income on their own tax return if the child is under 19 or a full-time student under 24 and meets other conditions.

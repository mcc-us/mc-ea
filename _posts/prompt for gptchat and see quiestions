I am a bookkeeper and I am studying for the IRS Enrolled Agent Exam. The exam consists of documents that discuss filing taxes with the IRS. In particular, there are at least 6 documents from the IRS that must be read before before answering the questions I will place below. The documents include:
1. publication 17.pdf
2. publication 343.pdf
3. publication 346.pdf
4. publication 556.pdf
5. publication 970.pdf
6. publication pcir230.pdf
Given all the information above can you answer these questions within 2-3 sentences, highlighting the most important information first.

Please format the output using Github markdown. Please use hashmarks for all headers. Use Outline numbering for all bullet points. I want to save this file as .md. I want the output to use Github markdown. The putput must be compatible, such that I can save the resultant to a file .md and have it ready for a reading.
